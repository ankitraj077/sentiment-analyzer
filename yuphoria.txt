i am impressed with flipkart for their fast delivery.
i got faulty piece like touch keypad was not working propery & little bit heating issue
it is good only thing is that its back cover is little thin and delicate, otherwise the product is satisfactory. then it is very light so easy to carry around.
Best phone in this price range !!! Well I can say the real tech freaks will love it the most!! Decent rear camera !! Very good platform for gaming . no lag seen
nice phone n nice clarity bt rear camera is nt dual n internal storage is 16 gb its nice bt a small problem with play store.
It is really sleak...battery remains for long...good features at a low cost...but battery gets very hot after using 20-30minutes.
Great Display 
Speed is good
Fast charging
Good touch experience
Big asset of front flash for selfie lovers for front camera
Frankly say this camera is not good back 13Mp and front 5Mp is not good, 
In low light camera was not at all good this price range.
Sound is low
No backlight for buttons
Main Disadvantage is Lake of Gorilla glass protection
Back door also very thin
This phone is very bad
Very Very Very Worst service..never buy this fone..Im facing so much problems in fone
