apple map is really bad for Indian users - difficult to find places, better to install Google Maps
Fast and responsive OS
Great features like 3D touch, Mute button, Fingerprint scanner, assistive touch, Excellent camera, Live photos, etc.
2gb Ram is really fast
Great battery backup and fast charging
Great gaming experience without lags
 Fast and responsive OS
iOS apps are really heavy!!
iBooks is very bad - no new books to buy only free versions are available
16 GB is not enough if you are an avid photographer or music lover.
Before I start I would like to say that I am neither an Apple nor Android Fanboy . I'm a simple customer who likes to get the worth for the 'Half Lakh' which is spent on a mobile phone and share my experience.
It is very easy to use. Just set it up and start using it.
I need not do things(fiddle with settings) to increase my user experience, The phone itself does that.
Absolutely no Lag or stutter at all. NEVER and NOT EVEN ONCE.
Everything is smooth and Faster.
The phone feels very strong and sturdy in hand.
Got my iPhone well on time but unhappy with the rapid price drops. Also did not receive a single reward point on shopping of such an expensive product. That's a bit disappointing
