#samsung galaxy j7
This is a nice mid range phone. Very reliable with its great battery life.
Yeah and it has a good camera too.
Plastic backs are so much better.
On all the new Samsung phones they're glass and if you don't use a case it's gonna get shattered pretty quick.
The Phone is really good but dont buy this phone from amazon or flipkart coz the cost of the phone is just Rs.13800 when u buy it from a local shop!!!
I did not expect this phone from samsung with such a wornderful price tag and features.. I was able to get it for 12600 INR.
Great Display 
Speed is good
Good Battery life
Fast charging
Good touch experience
Big asset of front flash for selfie lovers for front camera
Frankly say this camera is not good back 13Mp and front 5Mp is not good, 
In low light camera was not at all good this price range, i use galaxy s2, s3
Galaxy S2 8Mp camera is better than Galaxy j7
Sound is low
No backlight for buttons
Main Disadvantage is Lake of Gorilla glass protection
Back door also very thin
Low PPI
