"negative","the film is flat ."
"negative","the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable ."
"negative","it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated ."

"negative","a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages ."
"negative","a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply ."

"negative","a fascinating but choppy documentary ."
"negative","scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company ."
"negative","the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is ."

"negative","apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap ."
"negative","the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless ."

"negative","don't even bother to rent this on video ."

"negative","this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september ."
"negative","not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes ."
"negative","plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story ."
"negative","the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences ."

"negative","it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) ."
"negative","this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage ."
"negative","mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens ."

"negative","a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces ."
"negative","contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster ."
"negative","starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter ."
"negative","the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises ."
"negative","the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid ."
"negative","this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad ."

"negative","it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese ."
"negative","the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie ."
"negative","worthy of the gong ."
"negative","while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey ."
"negative","i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays ."
"negative","the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot ."
"negative","the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth ."
"negative","as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west ."
"negative","comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible ."
"negative","moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured ."

"negative","for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one ."
"negative","the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder ."
"negative",""" bad "" is the operative word for "" bad company , "" and i don't mean that in a good way ."

"negative","pompous and garbled ."
"negative","billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse ."
"negative","it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert ."

"negative","none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest ."
"negative","as social expos� , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on ."
"negative","the whole film has this sneaky feel to it � as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product ."
"negative","there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance ."
"negative","the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers ."

"negative","coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else ."
"negative","bad and baffling from the get-go ."
